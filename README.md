Individual Python Final Project Report:

1. Project Title
Number Guessing Game in Python-GUI-based using Tkinter

3. Project Issue/Problem to Be Solved
The problem is to design an entertaining, interactive game that dares the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing feedback to the user to direct them toward the correct answer. This project will be interesting for the users and instructive for the developers because it covers some very important notions regarding Python and GUI development.

4. Current Progress (PDLC)
Problem Analysis:
    The aim is to develop an intuitive number guessing game that includes user feedback and replay options.
    Design:
        User-friendly interface using Tkinter.
        Flowchart on the logic of user input, validation, feedback, and game completion.
    Development:
        Core functionality implemented, including random number generation, input validation, feedback system, and replay feature.
    Testing:
        Currently validating edge cases (non-numeric inputs, out-of-range guesses) and user interactions in different difficulty levels.

5. Project Functions/Features
    Generate random numbers based on difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
    Validate user input with error handling.
    Give hints ("Higher" or "Lower") in case of wrong guesses.
    Count the attempts
    Pop-up message on success/failure
    Restart the game with new settings
    GUI for user interaction

6. Expected No. of Pages / Interfaces
    Home/Welcome Screen: This will have the instructions and the selection of difficulty.
    Game Screen: To show the input field, to guess a button, and hint messages. 
    Result Popup: Success/failure messages.
    Replay Option: To replay the game.
